# mysqli-assignment-to-do-list-Atinder-Pal
**Purpose:** </br>
To create a To-Do App where user can add To-Do tasks and add their due dates. </br>
User can also move tasks to Completed Tasks List once he/she finishes a task. </br>
If a task is not marked completed by the user and it is past the due date- task should be displayed in the Ovedue Tasks List. </br>

**Author:** Atinder Pal</br>

**Instructions for Users:**</br>

    1.Rename constants.example.php to constants.php
    2.Add in your local database connection information
    3.You should be able to connect to the database and run to_do
    
**Unexpected Feature:** I added checkboxes instead of having one form for each task in the list
